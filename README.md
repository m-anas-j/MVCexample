# MVCexample
A very simple application demonstrating the basic working principle of the MVC design pattern.
The system takes a student ID as input and prints the student's name and semester.
No actual database implemented, the student name and semester values are hard-coded for the ID 154443.
Any other value of student ID will return "Idk" for name and "Irdk" for semester.
